She stated that she could not be more proud of him today for having lived such a wonderful life where he has achieved and accomplished so much in just one lifetime.</p><p>So, with good fortune and a loving husband, the former dancer is replenishing her life along with her ascending age.</p><h2>Her Husband Steven Was Married Thrice Previously</h2><p>Before marrying Erdenetuya, Steven was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> thrice, making Erdenetuya his fourth wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The actor first got married in 1974 to Miyako Fujitani, a Japanese Aikido instructor.

Their marriage ended in 1986.</p><p>“Once he was gone, he was gone ... On top of running the dojo, I had to raise my children. I don't know how we got by.

During the height of Hollywood's #MeToo movement, Erdenetuya's husband was also one of the celebrities accused of sexual misconduct. His history with sexual misconduct, however, goes way back before the marriage with&nbsp;her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Around their marriage, Erdenetuya 's husband was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved</a> in a&nbsp;$1 million sexual harassment lawsuit against his former assistant Kayden Nguyen.

During a recent interview with the BBC, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">walked</a> out on the interviewer when asked about his rape allegations&nbsp;even before completing her question.</p><p>Despite the overwhelming number of accusations, the actor&nbsp;has continued to deny all of his accusations. Erdenetuya, on the other hand, has remained silent, whether because of her loyalty to the husband or because she has no idea about all this is hard to tell.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Erdenetuya Enjoys Hefty Net worth with Actor Husband</h2><p>Whatever goes on with her husband on the outside, Elle's inside married life is garnished with luxury because of Steven's hefty net worth.&nbsp;</p><p>He is one of the&nbsp;most famous actors of Hollywood, who has had his hands in directing, writing, and producing the projects of the entertainment realm. He is also a&nbsp;martial artist who has skills in&nbsp;various&nbsp;arts, including&nbsp;Karate, Judo, Kendo,&nbsp;and Aikido.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With over three decades of dedication in the industry, the Under Siege actor has more than 50 acting credits on his&nbsp;list, which has helped him&nbsp;acclaim a total <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $16 million.</p><h2>Her Bio: Top Dancer of Her Country</h2><p>Erdenetuya was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> as&nbsp;Erdenetuya Batsukh in Mongolia and is famously known as Elle.
