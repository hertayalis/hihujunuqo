Not a hello, ignoring any questions we had for him,” they wrote.</p><p>The review continued, “I mentioned to him, with his lack of empathy, you work in hospitality and you’re being hostile, if you don’t want us to dine at your establishment then please ask us to leave. I won’t allow you to ever treat me or anyone that travel across the world to dine here feel unwelcome. Total disappointment and shame to such a great brand.”</p><p>Despite the rudeness from the host, the diner said that their waiter turned their experience around.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A customer claimed they were greeted with a “cold shoulder” and seated with a “disgusting attitude.” <span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The restaurant responded to the review, writing, “Thank you for your review.

Yet at his own place the food was bland, dry and possibly even processed frozen food,” one customer lamented.</p><p>“I had the reuben which was dry and the chicken sandwich, which we could’ve sworn was a frozen breast. It needed seasoning as it was very bland. They went and got good bread but everything else was average at best. We tried it, and will not be going back.
