Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>In 1983, BatDad was born in Georgia. December 20th is his birthday, making him thirty-six years old. He goes by Blake Wilson in real life. The former Vine Star is an American citizen of White ancestry.</p><p>BadDad’s mother is Sydney Bartlett Wilson, and his father is Seed Wilson. In a similar vein, his siblings Rob Wilson-Shaffer and Liz Wilson-Shaffer make up his family.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_BatDad_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of BatDad? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>In 2013, BatDad started his online journey by purchasing a mask for $10 and presenting his tranquil family to a new persona. But while he wore the mask and spoke in a husky voice to record moments with his family, his popularity on the now-defunct Vine platform shot through the roof.</p><p>By the end of Vine, he had amassed over 3 million followers. However, Vine’s demise did not mean that his online fame was finished because he continued to gain popularity on other platforms, like Facebook, where he currently has over 7.5 million followers.</p><p>In addition, he has continued to post frequently on Instagram, where he has 1.5 million followers. He has also achieved a lot of success with his YouTube channel.</p><p>His YouTube channel, “BatDad and Family,” boasts more than 759k subscribers. In a similar vein, more than 13 million people have watched some of his videos. By 2020, BatDad’s estimated net worth will reach $500 million.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>&nbsp;Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto" class=table><tbody><tr><th>Real Name</th><td>Blake Wilson</td></tr><tr><th>Birthday</th><td>20th December 1983</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>Georgia</td></tr><tr><th>Zodiac Sign</th><td>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>White</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>YouTuber</td></tr><tr><th>Married/Wife</th><td>Jen Wilson</td></tr><tr><th>Salary/Income</th><td>Under Review</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$500 thousand</td></tr><tr><th>Parents</th><td>Seed and Sydney Wilson</td></tr><tr><th>Siblings</th><td>Liz and Rob</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_BatDad_Married_Relationship>Is BatDad Married?

The couple’s four children are Ben, Sienna, Kaya, and Taylor.</p><p>But when Jen, BatDad’s mother, failed to show up in a few of his videos in 2019, fans were not happy. In response to a question about their breakup, BatDad disclosed that they were now going through a divorce.
