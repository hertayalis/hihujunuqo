<strong>$200,000</strong> at the time of his death in 1996.</p><p>Tupac sold over <strong>75 million</strong> records worldwide and garnered a sizable fortune to lead a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>In 1996 alone, Shakur sold <strong>$60 million</strong> worth of albums.</p><p>Despite that, his finances were a mess at the time he made his demise.</p><p>Pac earned <strong>$1.1 million</strong> from his debut album 2Pacalypse Now, which sold over <strong>923,455</strong> copies.</p><p>Similarly, in 1995, Shakur’s third studio album, Me Against the World, sold over <strong>3,524,567</strong> copies earning him<strong> $3.72 million.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TupacAlbum.jpg><p>Despite the fact that the rapper was active only for five years, he made an impeccable impact in the music world with his lyrically rich songs.</p><p>His fourth studio album, All Eyez on Me, released in 1996, the year he died, sold over <strong>5,887,630</strong> copies worldwide, earning him <strong>$6.12 million.</strong></p><p>Once a legend, always a legend, Tupac Shakur made money not only when he was alive but also after his death.</p><p>His posthumously released album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory sold over <strong>3,911,787</strong> copies in 1997, earning his estate <strong>$4.31 million.</strong></p><p>Interestingly, Shakur has been featured in the Forbes list

Death Row, when he passed away.</p><p>After his death, his mother Afeni took control of his estate because Pac died without a proper will.</p><p>Soon after discovering the withheld royalties and other incentives promised under his contract, Pac’s mother Afeni sued the Death Row record label.</p><p>However, the record company claimed that Pac’s financial issues were because of his spending spree.</p><p>The label submitted Pac’s finances that they had loaned in the year preceding his death.</p><p>As per the papers submitted, the company lent him several hundred thousand to buy himself cars and rent homes for himself and his family.</p><p>Similarly, they paid a staggering <strong>$300,000</strong> to Peninsula Hotel that Pac had racked in a single night.</p><p>This included limo service, jewelry, furniture, and security.</p><p>Besides, the company also paid <strong>$16,000 per month</strong> that Pac had arranged to support Afeni, his mother.</p><p>However, things got interesting when Pac’s mother threatened to forbid the release of his posthumous album “Makaveli: The Don Killuminati” to the record company.</p><p>After this Interscope, Death Row’s distributor immediately paid <strong>$3 million</strong> to his estate.</p><p>They also agreed to pay his estate <strong>$2 million</strong> in one year and hiked his royalties to 18%.</p><p>Pac’s debt of <strong>$4.9 million</strong> was forgiven by Death Row as well.</p><p>Afeni Shakur’s net worth at the time of her death in 2016 was a staggering <strong>$50 million,</strong> which came from Tupac’s estate.</p><p>After Pac died, her mother received tens of millions of dollars over the next several decades from the posthumous release of albums, merch sales, and several other forms of image licensing.</p><h2>Net Worth of Tupac Shakur in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s look into Tupac’s net worth in different currencies, including the famed cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</p><table
