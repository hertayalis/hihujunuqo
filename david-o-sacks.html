The all-star cast includes <a href=#>Aaron Eckhart</a>, William H. Macy, <a href=#>Sam Elliott</a>, Rob Lowe, <a href=#>Maria Bello</a>, Katie Holmes, <a href=#>Adam Brody</a>, and Robert Duvall.</p><p>In 2017, Sacks incubated a new startup called Harbor to enable the compliant issuance of private securities on the blockchain. As founding chairman, he brought together a team of former executives who had worked with him at Yammer and Zenefits to lead the new company.</p><p>In late 2017, Sacks co-founded Craft Ventures. It raised an initial fund of $350 million and has invested in companies including Bird, Bitgo, Cloud9, CloudKitchens, Harbor, Lightning Labs, Multicoin Capital, and SpaceX.</p><p>Sacks is a member of the "PayPal Mafia"—a group of founders and early employees of PayPal who went on to found a series of other successful technology companies. They are often credited with inspiring Web 2.0 and for the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the dot com bust of 2001.</p><p>In December 2014, Sacks became a shareholder in Zenefits, making a “major investment,” according to VentureBeat. In January 2016, Zenefits’ Board asked him to step in as interim CEO amidst a "regulatory crisis" regarding the company's licensing compliance. Over the next year, Sacks negotiated a resolution with insurance regulators across the U.S. – receiving praise for “righting the ship.” Sacks also revamped Zenefits’ product line with an initiative he named “Z2,” introducing a SaaS business model. Shortly after, PC Magazine would note Zenefits had become “the best HR software on the market.” After a CEO search, Sacks handed the reigns to former Ooyala CEO, Jay Fulcher.</p><p>In college, Sacks was the co-author – with Peter Thiel – of the 1995 book The Diversity Myth: 'Multiculturalism' and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford, published by The Independent Institute. The book is critical of political correctness in higher education and alleges that it has diluted academic rigor. In 2016, Sacks apologized for parts of the book, including claims that date rape was just "belated regret" and suggestions that the concept of date rape stemmed from a hatred of men.</p><p>In July 2012, Microsoft acquired Yammer for $1.2 billion as a core part of its cloud/social strategy. As of May 2018, employees at over 90,000 businesses worldwide use Yammer, including 85% of the Fortune 500 and a significant amount of the Global 2000.</p><p>In 2008, Yammer launched the first Enterprise Social Network, a secure solution for internal corporate communication and collaboration, winning the grand prize at TechCrunch50 conference. According to Social Capital, Yammer’s viral approach made it among the fastest-growing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies in history, exceeding eight million enterprise users in just four years. Yammer received approximately US$142 million in funding from venture capital firms such as Charles River Ventures, Founders Fund, Emergence Capital Partners, and Goldcrest Investments.</p><p>Thank You for Smoking was nominated for 2 Golden Globes in 2007 for Best Picture and Best Actor in the Comedy/Musical category. The movie also won: Best Screenplay at the Independent Spirit Awards, Audience Awards at both the Munich and Norwegian Film Festivals, Best First Feature at the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards, Best Adapted Screenplay at the Washington DC Film Critics Association Awards and the San Diego Film Critics Association Awards, and Top Films of the Year at the New York Film Critics Online.</p><p>On July 7, 2007, Sacks married Jacqueline Tortorice. The couple has two daughters and one son.</p><p>In 2006, Sacks founded Geni.com, a genealogy website that enables family members to collaboratively build an online family tree. At Geni, he wanted more visibility into what was going on across the organization, so the team created a productivity tool to help employees share information. In 2008, Sacks and co-founder Adam Pisoni spun this internal communications tool into a standalone company called Yammer. Geni was acquired by MyHeritage in 2012.</p><p>In February 2002, PayPal went public, it was one of the first IPOs after the September 11, 2001 attacks (ABCO went Public in November 2001). The stock rose more than 54% that first day and closed at $20.09. In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion.</p><p>In 1999, Sacks left his job as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company to join e-commerce service PayPal. As PayPal's COO and product leader, he built many of the company’s key teams, and was responsible for product management and design, sales and marketing, business development, international, customer service, fraud operations, and human resources functions.</p><p>Sacks graduated from Stanford University in 1994 and the University of Chicago Law School in 1998.</p><p>Sacks attended Memphis University School in Memphis, Tennessee. He earned his B.A. in Economics from Stanford University in 1994 and received a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1998.</p><p><a href=#>David Oliver</a> Sacks (born May 25, 1972) is an entrepreneur and investor in internet technology firms. He is general partner of Craft Ventures, a venture capital fund he co-founded in late 2017. Previously, Sacks was the founding COO and product leader of PayPal (acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion) and Founder/CEO of Yammer (acquired by Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion). In 2016, he led the turnaround of Zenefits as interim CEO. In 2017, Sacks co-founded blockchain startup Harbor as an incubation of Craft Ventures. His angel investments include Facebook, Uber, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies, Airbnb and Houzz.</p><p>Sacks was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and immigrated to Tennessee with his family when he was 5. Though Sacks didn't know he wanted to be an entrepreneur, he did not want to work a profession like his father, who was an endocrinologist. However, he took inspiration from his grandfather, who started a candy factory in the 1920s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfma63tcNmpmarkZi4tA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html&text=David%20O.%20Sacks%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html&title=David%20O.%20Sacks%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html&title=David%20O.%20Sacks%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html&title=David%20O.%20Sacks%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-o-sacks.html&description=David%20O.%20Sacks%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dean-bergeron-obituary-lowell-ma-dean-bergeron-has-passed-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dean Bergeron Obituary, Lowell MA, Dean Bergeron Has Passed Away">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-to-buy-the-adidas-x-marvels-spider-man-2-ultra-4d-advanced-shoes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where to buy the Adidas x Marvels Spider-Man 2 Ultra 4D Advanced shoes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
