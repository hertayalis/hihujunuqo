He is the youngest child of David and Laura Eubanks.&nbsp;</p><p>His father, Drew, worked as a mechanic while his mother was a nurse. His family migrated to the state of Oregon when Drew was just two. He attended Reynolds High School in Troutdale.</p><p>He grew up in a loving family environment playing with his older sister, Kelli. She was already into sports then, and she taught him softball while he was a young boy.</p><p>Kelli later played college softball for Colorado State University from 2008 to 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drew-Eubanks-mother.jpg><p>Eubanks was interested in other sports as well. He played groundball and basketball, too, but baseball was his favorite.</p><p>Even now, his most significant achievement besides getting into the NBA is winning Mt. Hood Conference title in baseball.</p><p>So, if he had not chosen basketball later in high school, he would have probably become a professional baseball player.</p><p>His path changed when the high school basketball coaches invited him and told his parents that he had a body type that would be fit for a basketball athlete.</p><p>Luckily, Drew decided to dedicate his time to basketball and joined his high school team.</p><p>His parents provided him with firm support and visited him during his matches to cheer him up, believing&nbsp;that it was probably what their son was made for.</p><p>He initially intended to obtain a degree in University Exploratory Studies but could not because he dropped out after his third year.</p><h2>Basketball Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Eubanks played both high school baseball and basketball tournaments for Reynolds School. However, growing tall, he left baseball and played only basketball as a senior.</p><p>Over time, he thrived as one of the best centers in his area, with high rebound scores every season. Continuing his form, he averaged 18.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in his senior season.</p><p>Consequently, he graduated from his high school as ESPN’s top basketball athlete in Oregon in 2015 and also a four-star recruit by ESPN.</p><h3>College Career</h3><p>After his high school graduation, Drew Eubanks joined Oregon State University for his college career. He said he chose the Oregon State Beavers because it was in his home state and was very close to his house.</p><p>Eubanks started his freshman (2015-16) season hoping for better performance but had an average game, with an average of 7.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, playing all 32 games of the season.</p><p>However, there were some positive things to note from his performance that season. He was the fourth-best in field goal percentage in the Pac-12 conference and the sixth-best freshman in his college’s history regarding his 146 rebounds.</p><p>After that season, his game improved, and his scores were far better. As a sophomore on a team that won five games, he averaged 14.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game.</p><p>As a junior, Eubanks averaged 13.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game. He skipped his last collegiate season for the 2018 NBA Draft.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Drew Eubanks was always among one of the most talked-about young athletes when he was actively playing high school and college basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>However, to his disappointment, no NBA team bid for him, and he remained undrafted in the 2018 NBA Draft. Luckily the San Antonio Spurs came to his rescue and signed him for the 2018 NBA Summer League.</p><p>Drew signed a two-way contract with the Spurs on September 17, 2018. A month later, he debuted in the NBA regular season against the Portland Trail Blazers, which they lost by 108-121.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drew-Eubanks-with-the-San-Antonio-Spurs.png><p>He stayed for two more seasons with the Spurs, during which the team offered him more matches. But he showed no improvement, so they released him in 2022.</p><p>Following his release, he played for his hometown team, Portland Trail Blazers, on a 10-day contract, on February 22, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Later from March 4, 2022, to April 3, 2022, Drew signed four more contracts, among which 3 were 10-day contracts, and the last was for the rest of the season.</p><p>After seeing his performance, Blazers signed him for a one-year contract on July 7, 2022.</p><p>Surprisingly, his performance for the Blazers was his best to date, averaging 14.5 points and 8.5 rebounds per game, and he played with players like <a href=# rel=noopener>Damian Lillard</a>.</p><p>Drew made <strong>a career-high for the 2022-2023 season was 27 points against Thunder on March 28, 2022.</strong></p><p>Now that his short-term contract with them is almost over, his fate remains undecided in the upcoming 2023 season.</p><h2>Net Worth & Career Earnings</h2><p>According to sources, the Portland Trail Blazers power forward has a net worth of around $1.5 million as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Initiating his playing career in 2018, the player mainly earns from professional league games as he does not have other business.</p><p>After failing to get drafted, the San Antonio Spurs hired him and paid him around $77 k for his rookie season.</p><p>They kept him for the second season and appeared for their D-League affiliate team, Austin Spurs, and received about $80k for that season.</p><p>The Spurs wanted to test his abilities for more time, so he extended his contract signing a new three-year deal worth $5.2 million in 2020; the team traded him to the Toronto Raptors in the middle of the 2021-22 season.</p><p>He was the 19th highest-paid athlete in the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2021-22 season, with an annual salary of about $477k.</p><p>However, he made the most money from his last season (2022-23), for which the Blazers paid him nearly $1.9 million.</p><p>The player has already accumulated around $5.8 million from his NBA career, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>Hoopshype</a>.</p><h3>Heart For Oregon Campaign</h3><p>In October 2020, Oregon witnessed one of the most enormous wildfires, with many people displaced from their residences. The fire devastated nearly 200,000 acres of land and burnt people’s houses.</p><p>It also caused much damage near the Oregon City Area, where Eubanks hails from. Food shortages and other basic needs in the state, and people needed help.</p><p>In such a situation, Drew teamed up with Portland Gear and launched a Heart for Oregon campaign to raise funds to help Oregon Food Bank. He donated around $5k to the cause.</p><p>They collected around $30k quickly, and many people immediately participated in the campaign seeing their star player engaging in the work.</p><p>Moreover, he covered the cost of making the printed “Heart for Oregon” t-shirts and urged his fans to buy them to contribute the collected amount to the Oregon Food Bank and relief units.</p><p>He expressed his sympathy to the troubled families during that difficult time and remarked that it was his first time doing such work, and he felt pretty contented doing it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Girlfriend</h2><p>The Oregon City native was happily married to his wife Hailey on August 20, 2022</p><p>During his engagement announcement with Hailey, he introduced her among his fans as “Mrs. Eubanks” through an Insta post in June 2020, with a photo of her finger with a ring.</p><p>Hailey and Eubanks are from Oregon and have known each other since college.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Drew-Eubanks-with-his-girlfriend-Hailey.jpg><p>However, unlike him, she attended Portland State University and graduated with multidisciplinary studies and a psychology degree in 2020.</p><p>Hailey portrays an image of a supportive wife and kind person in public as she encourages Drew by regularly appearing in his league matches.</p><p>Similarly, she actively participated with him in relief campaigns during the Oregon wildfire in 2020.</p><p>The couple spent most of their time together after they got married in 2022.
