Which is something you don't sit there and think about when you're with your close friends, if you take on those behaviours, your brain gets the message, 'Oh, I'm happy and comfortable here.'</p><p id=eRenklrBisIr data-wc=38>"<strong>The other thing to do is to say, 'Okay, who's not speaking up in this meeting?</strong> Who haven't been heard from and include them?'
